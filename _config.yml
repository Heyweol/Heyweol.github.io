      I'm presently in my junior year pursuing dual majors in Cartography & GIS and Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 

      I'm keen on leveraging my background in GIS analysis and software development to work on projects that sit at the intersection of both fields. 

      My academic background arms me with the skills to analyze spatial data intricately and develop robust computer programs.

      I'm looking forward to finding an internship work in summer 2024.
